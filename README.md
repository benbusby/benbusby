Hi, I'm Ben.

I work in the aerospace industry developing control software for [unmanned aircraft in demanding atmospheric environments](https://bst.aero).

In my free time, I primarily write privacy-focused open source software such as [Whoogle Search](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search), [Farside](https://github.com/benbusby/farside), and [YeetFile](https://github.com/benbusby/yeetfile). I'm in the process of starting a privacy-first tech collective called [meddlehead](https://meddlehead.com).

If you like my projects, please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/benbusby) or [donating on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/benbusby)!
